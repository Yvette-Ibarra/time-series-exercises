All JSON is technically valid JavaScript code; JSON is very commonly used as a data representation format, and is commonly used as a data interchange format. In fact, if you were to open up a jupyter notebook in a plain text editor, you would see a big JSON object. JSON data structures consist of arrays (analogous to lists in python), objects (dictionaries), strings, booleans, and numbers."
